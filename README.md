## Description

ShopSync - A shopping list application with syncronized lists between approved users.

Have you ever arrived at the grocery store only to realize the list you spent time making is nowhere to be found? Our application aims to solve that problem, we have designed this in a way that allows you to make a shopping list right on your phone! No more losing your scrap pieces of paper, forgetting it at home when you leave for the store or even forgetting it in your car to not realize until you're already in the store. I know that each one of those has happened to me personally and I'm sure at least one of them has happened to you. Our app allows you to write the name of each item as well as quantity. It also allows you to check off the items as you place them in your cart so you can make sure you've gotten everything needed. Our goal is not only to solve our real world issue but also to aid you in making grocery shopping as close to an enjoyable task as possible. We hope you find our app as useful as we will!

## Future Development

We plan to update our app as development proceeds, some of the features we would like to implement include but are not limited to:
